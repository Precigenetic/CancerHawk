Open source target discovery for cancer.


This repo is in building. As I write this, it is quite blank and needing of some love <3. 

Here is what I have in mind.

Let's start with TCGA. 

The Cancer Genome Atlas: https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga. 

Some pre-existing computational tools: https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga/using-tcga-data/tools.

Some papers using TCGA / Pan Cancer Atlas: https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/pancanceratlas/pancani3/index.html.

With that, here is the actual portal: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/. 

I am starting with Brain and Blood. Breast and Lung are great starting points too.

See you on the other side.
